This work will realize the use of asynchronous computing technique using DirectX 12. The hypothesis is to compute tessellation in parallel with shadow map rendering or postprocessing effects to reduce frame rendering time. For this purpose, camera position prediction will be introduced to compute tessellation in advance for the next frame. 
It's still a work in progress.
